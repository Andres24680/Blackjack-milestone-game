# NYU-SD-04 Milestone Project: Blackjack Game

_Before you start programming your project_... plan it!

Complete the planning sections below and include them in the README.md of your project repository. Once you're done, reach out to your instructional staff -- they'll examine your plan, help you scope it appropriately for the tools available to you and think ahead toward technical solutions, and point out any areas that could use any more thought. _Use the template below!_

## Project Description

_My idea for this project is to create a single-player blackjack game! I want to create the background like you are playeing on a blackjack table and have you play against the dealer. The way to beat the dealer is by getting as close to 21 as possible without going over, and having a stronger hand then the dealer.
Goodluck!!  _

## Game Logic

```
Have a win/loss counter on the screen 

Adding buttons to allow user to HIT or STAND 

Adding a restart to get a new hand while still keeping track of score 
```

## Deliverables

>Even if you have a great big idea for a game, it's important to scope this project according to what you can get done in the next two weeks. We'll refer to your project completion goal using the term **[Minimum Viable Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) (MVP)** -- a list of the criteria needed to "ship" a playable version of your game that meets the project requirements.
>
>*Don't lose sight of your big ideas, though! Keep a list of further improvements you can refer to as **Post-MVP Ideas**. You might finish some before our project time is done, or you might work on them later!*
>
> For your README, delete this blockquote and fill in the lists below.

### MVP Criteria

- One thing my game must do to meet my minimum standard.
- Another thing.
- Etc.

### Post-MVP Plans

- One great idea I hope to be able to add in before the project deadline.
- Another that will be a stretch.
- Something else I don't technically know how to do... *yet*. :)
