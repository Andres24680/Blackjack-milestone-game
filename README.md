# NYU-SD-04 Milestone Project: Blackjack Game


## Project Description

My idea for this project is to create a single-player blackjack game! I want to create the background like you are playeing on a blackjack table and have you play against the dealer. The way to beat the dealer is by getting as close to 21 as possible without going over, and having a stronger hand then the dealer.
You have 10 chances to beat the dealer
Goodluck!!  
## Game Logic

```
When you press HIT, you get issued a card. You can do this as much as you like as long you don't go BUST i.e go over 21.

Have a win/loss counter on the screen 

Adding buttons to allow user to HIT or STAND 

Adding a restart button to get a new hand while still keeping track of previous wins/loss

implement a auto win feature if your handed 21 

Add a hard reset that will make you start from scratch 


```

## Deliverables


### MVP Criteria

- Adding a score card
- Show "You won" or "You lose" on game end 
- Adding a restart button to deal a new hand but not resetting the win/loss score 
- Make sure the score collum properly represents the score

### Post-MVP Plans

- Maybe add a "Draw" collum 
- Give user ability to have currency to bet 
- add more ai users
